** TODO Ensure that textures are loaded in the correct orientation.
   DirectX has (0,0) be the top-left, rather than the bottom-left.
   DDS textures can sometimes be flipped on the Y-axis.
   Check to make sure that I have the correct orientation.
** TODO Direct reading from disk to VBO.
   Currently, parsing the OBJ files directly at runtime.
   Would be handy to just open a file, then dump directly to VBO.
** TODO .blend -> mesh/texture option, made at build time.
   Custom exporter, perhaps as shown here.

* Build script
** TODO Option for shared libraries.
   Faster to link for testing purposes.
   Release option should still compile into single binary.
